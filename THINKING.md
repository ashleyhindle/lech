# Overview
### API
Initially thought no tokens, but actually it would be good to show the considerations and middleware here.

So let's add some API tokens, but we'll simply seed some valid tokens for now.


### Web
Personal preference is livewire, super super fast, but if I need to show a frontend _using_ the API, then I'll use React, or maybe raw javascript/alpine.
